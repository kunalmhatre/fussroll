### Welcome, tester!

If you are viewing this page then probably it seems you are going to test our application, if yes, a big thanks to you and it is a kind request to you to read this entire document. It is a quick read and very important guidelines before you start your hacking. You being a tester now, should know some things that we really need from you. So let's get started.

#### Expected bugs

*   Fussroll isn't responding or Fussroll has stopped
*   Logic flaw
*   UI and UX issues

##### **Fussroll isn't responding** or **Fussroll has stopped**

You can identify this bug when in sudden a dialog box appears saying **Fussroll isn't responding** or **Fussroll has stopped** and you are provided with an option to close the application.

**What to report? :** All you need to remember are the steps you had taken which lead to this bug. For example, you tapped some button when using Fussroll or after scrolling the list of your friend's activities just after updating your activity. Just report the steps and we will look after the rest.

##### **Logic flaw**

What if the verification of your phone number fails even after you have entered right verification code? - That's the logic flaw. Something which results in wrong output when you give correct input. For example, you update your activity to "Feeling good" and after updating it, it showed you "Feeling bad" or a "Feeling bad" smiley to "Feeling good".

**What to report? :** The page (or section or input field) you were in and your input. For example, At the verification step, and the verification code.

##### **UI and UX issues**

###### **UI issues**

It results when some components like buttons, input fields does not respond. So let's say you press **Update** button and nothing happens, it's an UI issue, or it may happen that some part of the application is out of the view or looks very unpleasant. It may happen some components are not shown when you change your device's orientation from vertical to horizontal. **Tip :** Keep rotating device frequently while testing.

**What to report? :** The section or page of the application which has the issue and a small description of the issue

###### **UX issues**

You cannot see UX issues in reality, but you can feel it. _Was that too dramatic?_ Here, you may feel that something that we have done can be better. For example, you may find that Notification settings are used most of the time and we have kept it some where far or it may happen that you want the date to be shown in some other format like **February 2, 2016** and not like **2016-02-02**.

**What to report? :** Your suggestions or advices with a good description. **Note :** UX issues are very tough to deal with because it may happen that you feel something to change, but on the other side some other group of users may like it. So please, do not feel bad if we decide to not go after your good suggestion. We need to take care of you as well as too many other users.
