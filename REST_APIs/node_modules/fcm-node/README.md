fcm-node [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/fcm-node.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/fcm-node)
========
A Node.JS simple interface to Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Supports both android and iOS, including topic messages, and parallel calls.
## Installation

Via [npm][1]:

    $ npm install fcm-node

## Usage

    var FCM = require('fcm-node');

    var serverKey = '';
    var fcm = new FCM(serverKey);

    var message = { //this may vary according to the message type (single recipient, multicast, topic, et cetera)
        to: 'registration_token', 
        collapse_key: 'your_collapse_key',
        
        notification: {
            title: 'Title of your push notification', 
            body: 'Body of your push notification' 
        },
        
        data: {  //you can send only notification or only data(or include both)
            my_key: 'my value',
            my_another_key: 'my another value'
        }
    };
    
    fcm.send(message, function(err, response){
        if (err) {
            console.log("Something has gone wrong!");
        } else {
            console.log("Successfully sent with response: ", response);
        }
    });


## Notes
* See [FCM documentation][2] for general details.
* See [Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP Protocol][10] for details about the HTTP syntax used and JSON fields, notification and data objects. **(STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)**
* On **iOS**, set **content_available** when the app server needs to send a Send-to-Sync message. An inactive client app executes your logic in the background, while an app in the foreground passes the message to **didReceiveRemoteNotification**. (As seen in [FCM Docs][8])
* Some **iOS** users report a delay receiving the notifications and even a **'not receive at all'** scenario if the **priority** field is not set. This is due to a delivery policy with **APN** ([See APNs Provider API for a more detailed info][9])

## Changelog
1.0.14 - Added example file to quick tests <br />
1.0.13 - Added a error response in case of TopicsMessageRateExceeded response <br />
1.0.12 - Refactored the client removing the Event Emitter's Logic to fix concurrency issues. Using pure callbacks now also avoids memory leak in specific scenarios with lots of parallel calls to <b>send</b> function. <br />
1.0.11 - \<FIX\> send function returning error objects when multicast messages (or individually targeted) returned both error and success keys on response message (even with error counter = 0 ) <br /> 
1.0.9 - Updated Documentation <br />
1.0.8 - \<FIX\> 'icon' field no longer required in notification<br /> 
1.0.7 - renaming repository<br />
1.0.6 - bugfix: send function was always returning an error object for multicast messages (multiple registration ids)<br />
1.0.5 - bugfix with UTF-8 enconding and chunk-encoded transfers<br />
1.0.1 - forked from fcm-push and extended to accept topic messages without errors<br />
